Repository for CS305 Course

1. Artemis Financial is a financial services company that manages sensitive customer and transactional data. They wanted to strengthen the security of their software application by addressing existing vulnerabilities and making sure their systems complied with industry security standards. Specifically, they asked for a vulnerability assessment and code refactoring to safeguard against threats like data breaches, integrity issues, and insecure data transmission.

2. I identified weaknesses in the code and applied fixes, such as checksum verification for data integrity and the use of certificates for secure communication. I documented the issues and solutions, which showed an understanding of how vulnerabilities affect real-world applications. This was important because secure coding makes sure of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Coding securely is important because it prevents exploitation of software flaws, protects sensitive customer information, and maintains trust in the company. Software security directly supports a companyâ€™s reputation, compliance with regulations, and long-term stability.

3. The most challenging part was learnign how to use the maven dependencies as well as read and understand what each of the vulnerabilities meant.

4. I increased security layers by adding input validation, encryption, certificate use, and secure hashing algorithms. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, or static code analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities and follow threat modeling frameworks to guide my mitigation strategies.

5. After refactoring, I tested the code for both functional correctness and security flaws. I re-ran vulnerability scans to make sure no new issues were introduced. Testing after every major change confirmed that the application remained both functional and secure.

6. Some helpful resources included the OWASP Top 10 for awareness of common vulnerabilities, static/dynamic analysis tools, and secure coding guidelines like SEI CERT standards. These practices and tools will continue to be useful in future projects.

7. From this assignment, I could share examples of A vulnerability assessment report showing identified risks and proposed fixes, Refactored, secure code that demonstrates secure programming practices, and A summary of the testing and validation process that made sure of both security and functionality. These deliverables showcase my ability to identify risks, apply secure coding practices, and maintain software reliability skills employers value highly.
